Star Wars Rogue Squadron - Sui's Widescreen Tool
============
A little tool to make running Star Wars Rogue Squadron in widescreen easier. Consiting of Byte Replacing tool (for changing resolution and aspect ratio in game's exe) and DLL injector (which increases a draw FOV for terrain, to negate some of the graphical glitches).

Features
--------
  * Edits your EXE file to support a desired resolution.
  * Injects a code that increases your draw fov for terrain.
  
Installation
-------
This file has been tested only with Rogue Squadron v. 1.0.1.0! To use it place RogueSquadronUI.exe and widescreenfix.dll in your Rogue Squadron directory (where Rogue Squadron.EXE is). Then launch the program.

This has only been tested with first level so far and with D3D renderer (I assume Glide uses other bytes for resolution). Now, I'm off to sleep.

**Note**: For the program to work properly, Administrator rights may be required (especially for Widescreen hack). You can set it in Compatibility Options.
